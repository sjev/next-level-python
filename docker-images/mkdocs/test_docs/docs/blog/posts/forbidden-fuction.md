# Frorbidden function

During a dreary code review marathon, a developer named Tom came across a function named `DoNotTouchThis()`. Despite its stern warning, Tom's curiosity got the better of him, and he clicked to unveil its secrets.

Inside, to his amusement, was just one line of code: `return "I told you not to touch this";`. Laughing to himself, Tom decided to play along. He tweaked the function name to `SeriouslyDoNotTouchThis()`, added a note: "I'm watching you!", and committed the change.

The next day, his amusing tweak made the rounds in the team, providing a much-needed chuckle amidst the stress of the deadline. Tom's little prank not only lifted everyone's spirits but also immortalized `SeriouslyDoNotTouchThis()` as a beloved office meme.
